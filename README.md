# RockpaperMcScissorface

Play rock-paper-scissors on the Rinkeby testnet. Make sure you have Metamask pointed to one of your own accounts on the Rinkeby testnet. To run, clone the repo, `cd` into it, and run `npm start`. Anyone who wants to play against you currently also has to clone the repo and run the same command.
